Introduction
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of books to explore various aspects such as:
Distribution of publishing years
Genre analysis
Relationship between sale price and units sold
Total gross sales by author

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is Books_Data_Clean.csv, which contains the following columns:
Book Name: The title of the book
Author: The author of the book
Publishing Year: The year the book was published
Genre: The genre of the book
sale price: The sale price of the book
units sold: The number of units sold
Book_average_rating: The average rating of the book
Book_ratings_count: The total number of ratings received
language_code: The language of the book
Publisher: The publisher of the book
publisher revenue: The revenue generated by the publisher
Author_Rating: The rating of the author
gross sales: The total gross sales of the book

Key Findings

Fiction is the most popular genre, with the highest number of books.
There is a positive correlation between book average ratings and the number of ratings received.

Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to illustrate the findings, such as:
Histograms for the distribution of publishing years
Bar plots for genre counts
Scatter plots to analyze relationships between variables

Technologies Used
